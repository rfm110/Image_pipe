# Image_pipe
Pipeline building solution for 4D biological microscopy

This project is still in development. Initially started as a tool for Ruan, Zhou et al, Nature 2017, this pipeline has since grown to allow arbitrary pipeline construction based on a set of primitive functions and abstractions (pipe, tiling, per-segment processing, etc...).

This project is currently in pre-alpha development, hence undocumentend, contains no unit tests and prone to rapid changes.
